            Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the
            capital of the County of Barcelona. After merging with the Kingdom
            of Aragon, Barcelona continued to be an important city in the Crown
            of Aragon as an economic and administrative centre of this Crown and
            the capital of the Principality of Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich
            cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a
            major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the
            architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner,
            which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Since 1450,
            it is home to the University of Barcelona, widely considered the
            most prestigious university in Spain. The headquarters of the Union
            for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known
            for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class
            conferences and expositions and also many international sport
            tournaments.
